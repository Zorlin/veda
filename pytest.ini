# Logging is enabled for this tool.
#
# To analyse or troubleshoot between rounds, review the files in the logs/ directory:
#   - logs/harness_run.log: Full persistent log for the entire run (high-level overview, debugging)
#   - logs/iteration_XXX.log: Detailed log for each individual iteration (step-by-step analysis)
#
# Use these logs to trace execution, identify issues, and compare outcomes between rounds.
#
