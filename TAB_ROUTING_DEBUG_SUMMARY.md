# Tab Routing Bug Debug Summary

## Problem Description

Users reported that all messages were appearing on Tab 0 (Veda-1) even though logs showed messages were being routed correctly to their respective tabs. Messages from other tabs would appear on the main tab instead of their intended destination tabs.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue

The bug was in the **IPC spawning path** in `main.rs` around line 2509. When the system attempted to spawn new Claude Code instances for new tabs, it was using a random UUID instead of the actual ClaudeInstance ID:

```rust
// BROKEN CODE:
let spawn_result = crate::claude::send_to_claude_with_session(
    uuid::Uuid::new_v4(), // ❌ Random UUID instead of actual instance ID
    coordination_message_owned,
    tx.clone(),
    None,
    None,
).await;
```

### The Flow That Caused the Bug

1. **Tab Creation**: User creates new tab → new `ClaudeInstance` created with unique ID (e.g., `abc123`)
2. **Spawning Trigger**: Tab spawning triggers IPC coordination mechanism
3. **Wrong ID Used**: Spawn call uses `uuid::Uuid::new_v4()` (e.g., `def456`) instead of actual instance ID (`abc123`)
4. **Session Start**: Claude session starts and generates session ID (e.g., `session-xyz`)
5. **Message Routing**: Claude sends `StreamText` messages with `instance_id: def456` and `session_id: session-xyz`
6. **Routing Failure**: 
   - Session-based routing fails (session not yet established in UI)
   - Instance-based routing fails (no instance with ID `def456` exists)
   - Messages either get buffered indefinitely or routed to wrong tab

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

- The **coordination spawning path** (around line 2657) was already correctly fixed in commit `fbae064`
- The **IPC spawning path** (around line 2509) still had the bug
- The bug only manifested under specific spawning conditions (IPC-based spawning vs coordination-based spawning)

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**Fixed the IPC spawning path** to create the `ClaudeInstance` first, then use its real ID for spawning:

```rust
// FIXED CODE:
// Create the ClaudeInstance first so we have a real instance ID
let mut new_instance = ClaudeInstance::new(instance_name.clone());
new_instance.working_directory = working_dir.to_string();
new_instance.add_message("System".to_string(), coordination_message.clone());

let instance_id = new_instance.id; // Get the real instance ID
tracing::info!("Creating new tab: {} with instance_id: {}", instance_name, instance_id);
self.instances.push(new_instance);

// ... later in async closure ...
let spawn_result = crate::claude::send_to_claude_with_session(
    instance_id_owned, // ✅ Use the real instance ID, not a random UUID
    coordination_message_owned,
    tx.clone(),
    None,
    None,
).await;
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Consistent IDs**: The same UUID is used for both the `ClaudeInstance` and the Claude process
2. **Proper Routing**: When messages come back with the instance ID, routing can find the correct tab
3. **Session Fallback**: Even before session is established, instance-based routing works
4. **UI Consistency**: Tab appears immediately with correct instance context

## Technical Details

### Message Routing Logic

The routing logic in `process_claude_messages()` uses this priority:

1. **Session-first routing**: Try to find instance by `session_id` first
2. **Instance fallback**: If no session match, try to find by `instance_id`  
3. **Buffering**: If neither works, buffer messages for later

The bug broke step 2 because the instance ID in messages didn't match any real instance.

### Files Modified

- **`src/main.rs`**: Fixed IPC spawning path around lines 2480-2533
- No changes needed to `src/claude.rs` - session handling was correct

### Previous Related Fixes

- **Commit `fbae064`**: Fixed coordination spawning path instance ID capture
- **Commit `7d3be44`**: Updated SessionStarted handler for session-first routing

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works:

1. **Create new tabs** using various methods (Ctrl+N, IPC spawning, coordination)
2. **Send messages** to different tabs and verify they appear on the correct tab
3. **Check logs** to ensure instance IDs match between spawning and message routing
4. **Session switching** - verify messages continue routing correctly after session establishment

## Impact

- **High Priority**: Critical user experience bug that made multi-tab functionality unusable
- **Scope**: Affected all IPC-based tab spawning (subset of tab creation scenarios)
- **Fix Complexity**: Low - straightforward instance creation reordering
- **Risk**: Low - fix aligns with already-working coordination spawning logic
