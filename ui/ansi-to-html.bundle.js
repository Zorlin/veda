 * ansi-to-html.bundle.js

 * For now, use a UMD build for browser compatibility.

// If you want to use npm and a bundler, you must bundle this file to output a UMD or IIFE script.
// For now, fallback to a UMD build for browser compatibility:

// Remove all import/export statements. Instead, require the UMD build in index.html:
// <script src="https://unpkg.com/ansi-to-html@0.7.2/build/ansi-to-html.min.js"></script>

// This file is now intentionally left blank to avoid browser errors.
