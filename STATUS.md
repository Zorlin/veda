## goal.prompt

**Overall Mission:** Build a robust and reliable AI assistant capable of guiding software development tasks even in the face of unexpected errors and interruptions.

**Key Priorities (Next Phase):**

* **Stress Testing & Resilience:** Our immediate focus is on making Aiderbot *unbreakable*. We need to intentionally break it, identify vulnerabilities, and build in mechanisms for automatic recovery. This means creating a comprehensive suite of stress tests that simulate a wide range of failure scenarios: resource exhaustion, network issues, malformed test data, and more.  Document the results of these tests and prioritize fixes.
* **Proactive Stability:**  Moving beyond simply fixing errors, we aim to *prevent* them. This means implementing robust error handling, validating inputs rigorously, and building in safeguards to protect against common pitfalls.  Focus on designing for failure.
* **Maintain Core Functionality:** As we build robustness, it’s critical to ensure that our core abilities – dynamic goal prompting and reliable interruption handling – remain reliable and performant. Regression testing is essential.

**Guiding Principles:**

* **Fail Fast, Learn Quickly:**  Embrace experimentation and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement.
* **Prioritize Reliability:** Stability is paramount.  New features should not compromise the existing functionality.
* **Automate Where Possible:** Minimize manual intervention in testing and recovery processes.

**Remember:** We're not just building an AI assistant; we're building a *trusted* AI assistant.  This requires unwavering commitment to quality, reliability, and user experience.

## Goal.prompt

**Overall Direction:** Shift from feature development (dynamic prompts, reliable interruption) to rigorous system hardening and resilience testing. We're aiming for a robust and reliable AI assistant that gracefully handles unexpected issues.  Think "break it to fix it."

**Priorities:**

1. **Resilience & Stability Testing (Highest Priority):**  Dedicated effort to identify and fix weaknesses through aggressive and realistic testing. This is *more* important than adding new features.  Focus on scenarios involving resource exhaustion, network failures, and malformed data.  Establish metrics for graceful degradation and recovery.

2. **Interruption Handling Refinement:** Ensure the interruption mechanism not only functions correctly but also reliably cleans up after itself, even during complex operations. This includes thorough testing of edge cases and potential resource leaks.

3. **Dynamic Prompt Validation:**  Continue to refine and validate the dynamic prompt system, actively seeking vulnerabilities and ensuring that changes to instructions do not introduce unexpected behaviors or instability.

4. **Self-Healing Capabilities Exploration:** Investigate and prototype automated recovery mechanisms for common errors, such as process restarts and test re-executions. Prioritize solutions that minimize human intervention.

**Constraints & Considerations:**

*   All actions must remain aligned with the high-level goals defined in README.md (e.g., safety, accuracy, helpfulness).
*   Avoid adding significant new features until core system resilience is demonstrably improved.
*   Maintain thorough documentation of testing procedures and identified vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly review and update testing protocols to reflect evolving risks and potential failure modes.

**Key Question:** *How can we proactively break our system to make it stronger?*

## goal.prompt

**Overall Direction: Build a Robust and Self-Healing AI Assistant**

Our primary focus is now on creating an AI assistant, Aiderbot, that is exceptionally reliable and capable of gracefully handling unexpected failures. We're moving beyond simply building features to actively *strengthening* the system's resilience.  This means proactively finding and fixing weaknesses *before* they impact users.  Think of it as stress-testing the system to make it stronger, not just measuring its current capabilities.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Resilience First:** Every design and implementation decision should consider its impact on the system's ability to recover from errors.
*   **Proactive Failure Testing:** We will actively seek to break the system to identify and address vulnerabilities. This isn't about finding fault, it's about ensuring robust performance.
*   **Automatic Improvement:** When failures occur, the system should automatically update its guidance (this prompt) to prioritize fixing the root cause, ensuring we're constantly learning and improving.
*   **User-Centric Stability:**  Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and dependable experience for the user.  Resilience directly contributes to this.

**Next Steps (Prioritized):**

1.  **Simulate Real-World Failures:**  Develop and execute a comprehensive suite of tests simulating various failure scenarios: resource exhaustion, network outages, data corruption, unexpected input.
2.  **Enhance Interruption Handling:**  Ensure all interruptions are handled cleanly, preserving state and allowing for seamless resumption of tasks.
3.  **Prompt Stability & Verification:**  Thoroughly test the impact of any modifications to this prompt (goal.prompt) to prevent regressions and ensure continued stability.
4.  **Automated Recovery:** Implement mechanisms that allow Aiderbot to automatically recover from common errors, minimizing human intervention.  Think self-healing capabilities.
5. **Increase Observability:** Improve logging, monitoring and alerting to quickly detect and diagnose issues that occur in production.

**Crucially, remember that all actions must align with the high-level goals and constraints documented in README.md, particularly the emphasis on building a system that is exceptionally reliable, even under duress.**

This shift in focus represents a significant change in direction. It's not enough to simply build features; we must build a system that thrives when faced with adversity.  Let's build a truly robust and self-healing AI assistant.

```

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` designed to reflect the shift in direction, maintain alignment with the high-level goals, and guide the team effectively.  I've focused on clear direction and strategic focus, as requested.

```
**GOAL: Build a Resilient and Reliable AI Assistant**

**Overall Strategy:** Our primary objective is to engineer a robust AI assistant, "AiderBot," capable of consistently delivering a positive user experience *even when faced with unexpected errors or challenging conditions.*  We will achieve this through proactive vulnerability testing and automated self-correction.

**Critical Principles (Always adhere to these):**

*   **User-Centricity:**  Every decision must prioritize a seamless and reliable experience for the user.  Frustration due to errors is unacceptable.
*   **Proactive Resilience:**  We will *actively seek to break* the system. This isn't about finding excuses for failure; it's about deliberately uncovering weaknesses and building solutions.
*   **Automated Correction:** When errors *do* occur, we will prioritize automated recovery and self-correction over manual intervention.  The user should not notice the hiccup.

**Key Focus Areas for Next Phase:**

1.  **Aggressive Stress Testing:**  Simulate a wide range of real-world failure scenarios, including:
    *   Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)
    *   Network instability and outages
    *   Corrupted or malformed data inputs
    *   Unexpected user behavior

2.  **Automated Recovery Mechanisms:**  Implement systems that automatically detect and correct errors, such as:
    *   Component restarts
    *   Data validation and cleansing
    *   Fallback procedures for critical functionalities

3.  **Prompt Stability & Security:** Continuously evaluate the stability and security of the goal prompts against malicious or unintended behaviors. Ensure prompts don't inadvertently create unpredictable results or vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Monitoring & Learning:**  Establish comprehensive monitoring tools to track system health and identify potential failure points.  Use this data to continuously improve resilience.

**Important Reminder:**  The overarching goal is *not* to eliminate errors entirely (that's impossible). It is to design a system that *handles* errors gracefully, minimizes disruption to the user, and automatically recovers whenever possible. Document all testing procedures and findings meticulously.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Considerations:**

*   **Explicit Resilience Focus:** The prompt directly emphasizes "resilience" and "handling" errors.
*   **Proactive Vulnerability Testing:** This is a core directive—actively trying to break the system.
*   **Automated Correction:** A major shift towards self-healing capabilities.
*   **Simplified Language:**  I'm using clear, high-level language rather than technical jargon.
*   **Reminders/Principles:**  I’m including principles at the start to reinforce the core strategy.
*   **Specific Focus Areas:** This provides direction on *what* to prioritize in the next phase.
*   **Document everything:**  Highlights the need for proper documentation.
* **Prompt Stability & Security:** Addressed a newly recognized vulnerability that wasn't in previous prompts.



This new `goal.prompt` is designed to be a guiding document that sets the overall strategic direction for the team, focusing on building a robust and user-friendly AI assistant.

When all tests pass, we want to keep going with the new direction and run Aider again, not just gracefully exit. Aiderbot should be designed to run 24x7.

---


Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` designed to reflect the shift in direction, maintain alignment with the high-level goals, and guide the team effectively.  I've focused on clear direction and strategic focus, as requested.

```
**GOAL: Build a Resilient and Reliable AI Assistant**

**Overall Strategy:** Our primary objective is to engineer a robust AI assistant, "AiderBot," capable of consistently delivering a positive user experience *even when faced with unexpected errors or challenging conditions.*  We will achieve this through proactive vulnerability testing and automated self-correction.

**Critical Principles (Always adhere to these):**

*   **User-Centricity:**  Every decision must prioritize a seamless and reliable experience for the user.  Frustration due to errors is unacceptable.
*   **Proactive Resilience:**  We will *actively seek to break* the system. This isn't about finding excuses for failure; it's about deliberately uncovering weaknesses and building solutions.
*   **Automated Correction:** When errors *do* occur, we will prioritize automated recovery and self-correction over manual intervention.  The user should not notice the hiccup.

**Key Focus Areas for Next Phase:**

1.  **Aggressive Stress Testing:**  Simulate a wide range of real-world failure scenarios, including:
    *   Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)
    *   Network instability and outages
    *   Corrupted or malformed data inputs
    *   Unexpected user behavior

2.  **Automated Recovery Mechanisms:**  Implement systems that automatically detect and correct errors, such as:
    *   Component restarts
    *   Data validation and cleansing
    *   Fallback procedures for critical functionalities

3.  **Prompt Stability & Security:** Continuously evaluate the stability and security of the goal prompts against malicious or unintended behaviors. Ensure prompts don't inadvertently create unpredictable results or vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Monitoring & Learning:**  Establish comprehensive monitoring tools to track system health and identify potential failure points.  Use this data to continuously improve resilience.

**Important Reminder:**  The overarching goal is *not* to eliminate errors entirely (that's impossible). It is to design a system that *handles* errors gracefully, minimizes disruption to the user, and automatically recovers whenever possible. Document all testing procedures and findings meticulously.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Considerations:**

*   **Explicit Resilience Focus:** The prompt directly emphasizes "resilience" and "handling" errors.
*   **Proactive Vulnerability Testing:** This is a core directive—actively trying to break the system.
*   **Automated Correction:** A major shift towards self-healing capabilities.
*   **Simplified Language:**  I'm using clear, high-level language rather than technical jargon.
*   **Reminders/Principles:**  I’m including principles at the start to reinforce the core strategy.
*   **Specific Focus Areas:** This provides direction on *what* to prioritize in the next phase.
*   **Document everything:**  Highlights the need for proper documentation.
* **Prompt Stability & Security:** Addressed a newly recognized vulnerability that wasn't in previous prompts.



This new `goal.prompt` is designed to be a guiding document that sets the overall strategic direction for the team, focusing on building a robust and user-friendly AI assistant.

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` based on the provided information, designed to reflect the strategic shift towards proactive resilience and continuous improvement.  It's written as high-level guidance.

```
## Goal.Prompt: Aiderbot - Focus on Resilience & Continuous Improvement

**Overall Direction:**  Our primary focus is now building a demonstrably resilient and continuously improving Aiderbot. We are shifting from reactive problem-solving to *proactive* identification and mitigation of potential failures. This means actively seeking to "break" the system and rigorously testing its ability to recover gracefully and adapt to changing conditions.  Maintaining a positive and reliable user experience remains paramount.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity:**  View failures during testing as valuable data points, not setbacks.  Thoroughly analyze failures to understand root causes and implement preventative measures.
*   **Proactive Stress Testing:**  Prioritize rigorous stress testing under a wide range of adverse conditions. Simulate resource exhaustion, network disruptions, and data corruption. Go beyond nominal scenarios.
*   **Continuous Adaptation:**  Ensure the system is designed to adapt and improve based on ongoing testing and user feedback.  The automated prompt update mechanism is vital; use it to reflect lessons learned.
*   **Graceful Degradation:**  When failures *do* occur (and they will), focus on ensuring the system degrades gracefully. Prioritize maintaining core functionality even under duress.
*   **User-Centricity:**  All decisions must be evaluated through the lens of the user experience.  Reliability and predictability are paramount.

**Key Priorities (Next Phase):**

1.  **Resilience Testing Blitz:** Conduct a concentrated effort to stress-test Aiderbot, actively attempting to trigger failures and observing recovery. Document findings meticulously.
2.  **Interrupt Handling Refinement:**  Focus specifically on ensuring interrupt handling is robust and predictable across diverse system states.
3.  **Prompt Resilience & Adaptation:**  Utilize automated prompt updates to embed resilience best practices and adapt to evolving system complexities. The prompt should actively *reflect* the lessons learned from testing.
4.  **Graceful Degradation Strategy:** Develop and implement strategies for graceful degradation during failure scenarios, minimizing user impact.

**Remember:**  This isn't just about fixing bugs; it’s about designing a system that anticipates and withstands them. The success of Aiderbot hinges on its ability to reliably serve users, even when faced with unforeseen challenges.
```

**Explanation of Choices and Alignment with the Given Context:**

*   **Significant Shift:** The prompt directly addresses the stated shift from reactive to proactive resilience.  The phrases "actively attempting to 'break' the system" and "designed to anticipate and withstand them" highlight this change.
*   **README.md Alignment:** The prompt emphasizes “reliability” and a “positive user experience,” aligning with likely goals in a project's README.
*   **Actionable Guidance:** The "Key Priorities" section provides clear next steps for the development team.
*   **Preservation of Core Instructions:** The original prompt likely emphasized functionality and user satisfaction. This revised prompt retains that focus while adding a critical layer of resilience.
*   **Project Evolution:**  The prompt acknowledges and builds upon the progress detailed in the PLAN.md documents, particularly the introduction and usage of automated prompt updates.
*   **Plain Language:** The language is intended to be easily understood by a human team, avoiding technical jargon.
*   **Conciseness and Focus:**  The prompt is designed to be brief and to-the-point, avoiding unnecessary details.

## Goal.Prompt: Fortify Aiderbot - Prioritize Resilience and Proactive Vulnerability Discovery

**Our Primary Objective:** To build a supremely reliable and user-friendly Aiderbot, capable of gracefully handling unexpected errors and maintaining a seamless user experience.

**Strategic Shift:** We are moving from primarily focused on foundational functionality to a concentrated effort on proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. We will embrace a “break it to fix it” mentality, actively testing the system’s limits and ensuring robust error handling.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Aggressive Testing:** Design and execute rigorous stress tests simulating a wide range of potential failures - resource limitations, network instability, unexpected data inputs, and more. Prioritize finding *edge cases* that can expose weaknesses.  Assume failures will occur and build to handle them.
* **Automated Resilience:** Investigate and implement automated recovery mechanisms. Focus on solutions that allow Aiderbot to detect, diagnose, and automatically correct errors with minimal user intervention.  The user shouldn’s be aware that anything went wrong.
* **Prompt Stability & Proactive Review:** Any changes to the goal.prompt or underlying system should be subjected to a focused "break it" test before deployment.  Assume the change *will* introduce an issue.
* **Continuous Learning:** Closely monitor error logs and performance data to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement.  Treat every failure as a learning opportunity.

**Maintain Alignment with Core Principles:**

* **User-Centricity:**  Always prioritize the user experience.  Resilience should enhance, not hinder, usability.
* **Simplicity:** Aim for clear, understandable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Scalability:**  Build systems that can handle increasing demands and potential future growth.

**Remember:** Our goal isn't just to *function*; it’s to thrive under pressure and provide a consistently excellent user experience, even when things go wrong.  Our biggest risks are complacency and assuming that the code “just works”.

## New goal.prompt:

**Overall Mission:** Build and maintain a reliable, user-friendly AI assistant that consistently delivers value even in unexpected circumstances.

**Current Focus: Proactive Resilience & Automated Healing**

We’re shifting our primary effort from initial feature development to *robustness testing and automated recovery*.  This means actively searching for potential failure points, and designing systems that can automatically respond to and resolve common issues.  Think of it as building a car, then putting it through rigorous crash tests and designing features that minimize damage and get it back on the road quickly.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Break It to Fix It:** Actively design and execute tests that deliberately try to break Aiderbot.  This isn't about finding flaws to punish the team; it's about identifying weaknesses *before* they impact our users.
* **Automated Response:**  Where possible, design systems that automatically handle common errors – restart components, re-run tests, gracefully degrade functionality. The goal is for the user to experience minimal disruption.
* **Constant Vigilance:**  We're not just testing once; we're building a culture of ongoing resilience checks and improvements.
* **User Experience First:** Even as we focus on robustness, user experience remains paramount.  Automated solutions should be invisible to the user whenever possible.



**Always remember:** Our ultimate goal is to provide a valuable and dependable service. This requires a focus not just on what Aiderbot *can* do, but on how well it can *handle anything*.

-**Strategic Shift:** We are moving from primarily focused on foundational functionality to a concentrated effort on proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. We will embrace a “break it to fix it” mentality, actively testing the system’s limits and ensuring robust error handling.
+**Current Focus: Proactive Resilience & Automated Healing**
+
+We’re shifting our primary effort from initial feature development to *robustness testing and automated recovery*.  This means actively searching for potential failure points, and designing systems that can automatically respond to and resolve common issues.  Think of it as building a car, then putting it through rigorous crash tests and designing features that minimize damage and get it back on the road quickly.
 
 **Key Priorities:**
 
-* **Aggressive Testing:** Design and execute rigorous stress tests simulating a wide range of potential failures - resource limitations, network instability, unexpected data inputs, and more. Prioritize finding *edge cases* that can expose weaknesses.  Assume failures will occur and build to handle them.
-* **Automated Resilience:** Investigate and implement automated recovery mechanisms. Focus on solutions that allow Aiderbot to detect, diagnose, and automatically correct errors with minimal user intervention.  The user shouldn’s be aware that anything went wrong.
-* **Prompt Stability & Proactive Review:** Any changes to the goal.prompt or underlying system should be subjected to a focused "break it" test before deployment.  Assume the change *will* introduce an issue.
