#### Content Changes
Previous goal.prompt:
```
please improve Veda by 
* making sure it reliably and successfully runs Aider and follows its output
* has an extensive but intuitive webUI that allows for easy building of software
* utilises AI input efficiently and actually uses what it says

```

New goal.prompt:
```
please improve Veda by:

*   **Prioritizing a user-centric and intuitive web UI:** The primary focus for the next development cycle is a significantly enhanced web interface. This UI should drastically simplify software creation and management for users with varying technical expertise. We need it to be genuinely easy to use, guide users through the process, and clearly communicate Veda’s actions.  This supersedes the previous emphasis on simply "reliably running Aider." Reliable operation is expected; usability is now the key differentiator.

*   **Optimizing AI utilization for UI effectiveness:** Investigate how AI can be leveraged *within* the UI itself to enhance user experience. This includes intelligent prompting assistance, automated task suggestions, and proactive guidance based on user behavior.  The goal is not just to *use* AI, but to intelligently *integrate* it into the user workflow.

*   **Continuously refining Aider integration:** Ensure Aider's output is effectively translated into actions within the UI and project.  While this remains important, the focus is now on *how* Aider's work is presented and managed by the user through the UI.



Remember to adhere to all high-level goals and constraints outlined in the project's README.md.

```
Focus on creating an exceptionally user-friendly and accessible AI-powered development environment. While maintaining core functionality, the immediate priority is a complete overhaul of the user interface to cater to users with varying levels of technical expertise.  This means simplifying workflows, providing clear explanations, and integrating AI to proactively assist users, not just react to their commands.

Specifically:

*   **Prioritize User Experience:** Every design and development decision must be evaluated through the lens of user accessibility and ease of use.
*   **Integrate AI Proactively:** Explore how AI can anticipate user needs and provide contextual guidance within the UI, rather than just processing requests.
*   **Simplify Technical Complexity:**  Abstract away technical jargon and present information in a clear, understandable format.  Focus on outcomes and actionable steps.
*   **Maintain Core Functionality:** Ensure changes do not compromise the fundamental capabilities of the system.

Ultimately, the goal is to transform the development environment into a tool that empowers a broad range of users, regardless of their technical background.

## CRITICAL: Fix pytest test failures

The system has detected pytest test failures that must be fixed before proceeding with other tasks.
This is now your highest priority task. You need to fix the pytest test failures.

Please:
1. Carefully analyze the test output to understand the specific failures
2. Fix each failing test systematically
3. Ensure your changes don't introduce new regressions
4. Add additional tests to prevent similar failures in the future
5. Focus on making the system more resilient to unexpected conditions

If using pytest, ensure:
- All test cases pass without errors
- Error handling is robust and graceful
- Resource cleanup happens properly even during failures
- The code meets the project's quality standards
- The system can recover from similar failures automatically in the future

Remember that improving system resilience is the highest priority according to the project goals.

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a proposed new `goal.prompt` based on the provided context. I've focused on the strategic shift toward user experience and accessibility, while respecting the existing high-level goals.

```
**Goal Prompt: Elevate User Accessibility and Expand Project Impact**

Our primary focus now is to transform the project into a truly accessible tool for a broad audience, not just technically proficient users.  While maintaining the core functionality and performance that are foundational to the project's value, we must radically improve the user experience.

Specifically, we aim to:

*   **Prioritize User-Centric Design:**  All development efforts should be guided by user feedback and usability testing, ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to learn, even for individuals with limited technical expertise.
*   **Democratize Access:**  The ultimate measure of our success will be the ability of a wider range of users – including those without a strong technical background – to effectively utilize the project's capabilities.
*   **Maintain Core Value:**  While prioritizing UX improvements, we must not compromise the underlying robustness, efficiency, and reliability that define the project's core purpose and provide it’s key functionality.

This shift necessitates a change in our development approach: UX and accessibility will be considered paramount in all decision-making.  We're not just building a functional tool; we're building a truly *usable* tool that can empower a wider community.
```

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Clear Strategic Shift:** The prompt directly states the shift toward UX and accessibility.
*   **Actionable Guidance:** It provides concrete direction ("UX and accessibility will be considered paramount...").
*   **Maintains High-Level Goals:** It acknowledges the need to maintain core functionality, aligning with the project's foundational goals.
*   **Human-Readable:** It’s written in plain language, avoiding technical jargon.
*   **Concise:** It's focused on the overall direction and not implementation details.
*   **Reflects PLAN.md Evolution:** It captures the changes in focus highlighted in the various council round summaries.



This revised prompt sets the stage for a significant shift in focus without prescribing specific technical implementations. It empowers the development team to explore solutions while keeping the overarching goal of improved accessibility and broader impact at the forefront.
