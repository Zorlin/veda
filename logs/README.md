# Log Directory Structure

This directory contains logs generated by the harness tool for analysis between rounds.

- `harness_run.log`: Rotating persistent log capturing all messages from all modules for the entire run.
- `iteration_XXX.log`: Per-iteration log files (one per round), containing detailed logs for each iteration.

You can analyse these logs to understand the behaviour of the tool, debug issues, and review the outcome of each round.
