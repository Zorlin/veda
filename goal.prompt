## New goal.prompt

**Overall Goal:** Build a resilient and user-friendly Aiderbot experience by proactively identifying and mitigating potential failure points.

**Strategic Focus:** Shift from feature development to robustness and user recovery. Prioritize identifying and resolving how Aiderbot handles unexpected situations and errors, ensuring users can quickly and easily recover from any issues.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

*   **Proactive Failure Identification:** Intensify testing with challenging and unusual scenarios, not just validating expected functionality.
*   **Seamless User Recovery:** Design and implement clear, informative error messages and recovery paths that minimize user frustration and ensure continued progress towards goals.
*   **Team Enablement:** Create and maintain clear documentation of common failure scenarios and their resolutions to expedite troubleshooting and improve team responsiveness.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review user experience during error scenarios to identify opportunities for refinement and ensure a positive overall experience even when things go wrong.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always prioritize user experience and minimize disruption during error recovery.
*   Documentation and knowledge sharing are critical for maintaining and improving long-term reliability.
*   All development must remain aligned with the overarching principles and constraints outlined in the project's README.md.



This new goal.prompt emphasizes a shift towards building a robust system, rather than simply adding features. It emphasizes proactively discovering and resolving potential problems, documenting solutions, and ensuring users have a positive experience even when errors occur.
