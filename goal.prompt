### Council Round 11 (2025-04-13 10:20:11)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** We're shifting our focus from building Aiderbot’s core functionality to rigorously testing its resilience and reliability. We're confident the foundational pieces are solid, and Aiderbot is now capable of learning and adapting from testing. The current priority is to proactively identify and resolve any potential weaknesses before users experience them, ensuring a consistently smooth and dependable experience. We've started stress testing and are actively searching for edge cases.

Please review this plan and either:
1. Approve it as is (respond with "APPROVED: " followed by the original plan)
2. Suggest improvements (respond with "IMPROVED: " followed by your improved version)

Your improved version should:
- Maintain the same format but enhance the content
- Use plain language that a human would write
- Focus on high-level strategic direction rather than technical details
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Avoid AI-like language patterns and technical jargon
- Ensure continuity with previous council rounds in PLAN.md

Remember that:
- The open source council must review and update PLAN.md at the end of each round to reflect the current actionable plan, strategies, and next steps.
- Only update goal.prompt if a significant change in overall direction is required (which is rare).
- All planning and actions must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.
- All tests must pass to continue and commit to a direction. After a few tries, the council can revert to a working commit.

Remember that PLAN.md is meant to contain plain language, high-level direction that guides the project.



goal.prompt:

"Your primary goal is to ensure Aiderbot is a reliably helpful assistant. Focus on robustness and graceful recovery from errors.  Specifically, prioritize the following:

*   **Find and fix weaknesses:**  Actively seek out ways Aiderbot might fail or behave unexpectedly, especially in unusual or stressful situations.
*   **Communicate clearly during interruptions:** When Aiderbot encounters a problem, provide users with clear explanations and easy recovery options.
*   **Learn from failures:**  Document common failure points so we can quickly resolve issues and prevent them from recurring.

Remember that a user's trust in Aiderbot depends on its ability to consistently provide a positive experience, even when things don’t go perfectly."
