make it so the open source council convenes each round to work on planning,
 and together collaboratively update PLAN.md (very frequent)
and goal.prompt (rare, only for major shifts)
the high level goals set out in README.md should always be respected

Instructions:
- At the end of each round, the open source council must review and update PLAN.md to reflect the current actionable plan, strategies, and next steps.
- Only update goal.prompt if a significant change in overall direction is required.
- All planning and actions must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.
