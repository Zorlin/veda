## New goal.prompt:

**Overall Mission:** Build and maintain a reliable, user-friendly AI assistant that consistently delivers value even in unexpected circumstances.

**Current Focus: Proactive Resilience & Automated Healing**

We’re shifting our primary effort from initial feature development to *robustness testing and automated recovery*.  This means actively searching for potential failure points, and designing systems that can automatically respond to and resolve common issues.  Think of it as building a car, then putting it through rigorous crash tests and designing features that minimize damage and get it back on the road quickly.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Break It to Fix It:** Actively design and execute tests that deliberately try to break Aiderbot.  This isn't about finding flaws to punish the team; it's about identifying weaknesses *before* they impact our users.
* **Automated Response:**  Where possible, design systems that automatically handle common errors – restart components, re-run tests, gracefully degrade functionality. The goal is for the user to experience minimal disruption.
* **Constant Vigilance:**  We're not just testing once; we're building a culture of ongoing resilience checks and improvements.
* **User Experience First:** Even as we focus on robustness, user experience remains paramount.  Automated solutions should be invisible to the user whenever possible.



**Always remember:** Our ultimate goal is to provide a valuable and dependable service. This requires a focus not just on what Aiderbot *can* do, but on how well it can *handle anything*.
