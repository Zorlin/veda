*   **Summary of Last Round:** The team successfully transitioned from building Aiderbot's core features to focusing on making it robust and reliable. We're ensuring it can handle unexpected situations and recover gracefully when things go wrong. Aiderbot’s ability to learn from testing is proving valuable. Our focus now is on proactively identifying and addressing any potential weaknesses before users experience them, reinforcing the foundation of a consistently positive experience.
*   **Blockers/Issues:** Currently, there are no significant blockers. We're monitoring the ongoing stress testing to identify any unforeseen edge cases. A potential area for improvement is documentation of failure scenarios for quicker troubleshooting.
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Intensify Stress Testing:** Continue rigorous testing with a focus on edge cases and unusual data inputs, specifically targeting areas identified in the last round’s review.
    *   [ ] **Refine Failure Recovery:** Improve Aiderbot's messaging and handling when errors or interruptions occur – making sure users are informed and can easily get back on track.
    *   [ ] **Document Failure Scenarios:** Create a clear guide outlining common failure points and recommended recovery steps for the development team. This will significantly speed up future troubleshooting and improvements.
    *   [ ] **User Experience Review:** Conduct a review of the user experience during error recovery, ensuring it’s intuitive and reassuring.
*   **Reference:** This plan must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

"Your primary goal is to ensure Aiderbot is a reliably helpful assistant. Focus on robustness and graceful recovery from errors.  Specifically, prioritize the following:

*   **Find and fix weaknesses:**  Actively seek out ways Aiderbot might fail or behave unexpectedly, especially in unusual or stressful situations.
*   **Communicate clearly during interruptions:** When Aiderbot encounters a problem, provide users with clear explanations and easy recovery options.
*   **Learn from failures:**  Document common failure points so we can quickly resolve issues and prevent them from recurring.

Remember that a user's trust in Aiderbot depends on its ability to consistently provide a positive experience, even when things don’t go perfectly."
