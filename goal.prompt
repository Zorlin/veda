Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` incorporating the changes and directions from your `PLAN.md` and maintaining the overall intent.  I've tried to keep it as human-readable and strategic as possible, minimizing technical directives.  I'm presenting it as the full replacement content, ready to be saved as `goal.prompt`.

## Agent Harness – Strategic Guidance & Objectives

This document outlines the overall strategic direction and objectives for the Agent Harness. It is intended to guide the team and should be reviewed periodically to ensure continued alignment with the broader project goals. Updates to this document should be rare and reserved for significant shifts in direction.  All work must respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

**Overall Mission:** To develop an autonomous agent capable of continuously improving its performance and contributing meaningfully to [State the overall purpose/goal of the agent harness here – e.g., "software development," "data analysis," "scientific research"].

**Key Principles:**

*   **Continuous Improvement:** The agent should be designed to constantly learn from its experiences and refine its operations. This includes analyzing its own actions and identifying areas for optimization.
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Minimize human intervention and maximize the agent’s ability to operate independently.
*   **Transparency & Explainability:** While autonomy is critical, maintain a level of transparency into the agent’s decision-making processes.  This aids in understanding its actions and ensuring alignment with ethical guidelines.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Base all decisions and refinements on data, evidence, and rigorous analysis.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Facilitate an adaptable and responsive agent that can handle changes in its environment.

**Current Strategic Focus (Based on Council Reviews):**

The immediate focus is on strengthening the agent's self-assessment and learning capabilities. This means moving beyond simply executing tasks to actively analyzing its own performance and identifying areas for improvement.

**Specific Areas of Focus for the Next Phase:**

*   **Automated Self-Analysis:** Develop and implement mechanisms for the agent to automatically analyze its own actions and identify inefficiencies or errors. This analysis should go beyond surface-level metrics and delve into the underlying reasoning behind its decisions.
*   **Closed-Loop Learning:**  Create a closed-loop feedback system where the agent's self-analysis directly informs its future actions. This should include automatic adjustment of parameters, refinement of algorithms, and optimization of workflows.
*   **Enhanced Logging & Observability:**  Improve the agent’s logging capabilities to provide a comprehensive record of its actions, decisions, and rationale. This enhanced observability is crucial for both the agent's self-analysis and human oversight.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Develop a robust testing suite specifically designed to evaluate the agent’s self-assessment and learning capabilities. This testing should assess not only the agent's ability to perform tasks but also its ability to identify and correct its own mistakes.
*   **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:** Ensure thorough documentation of the agent’s architecture, processes, and decision-making logic to facilitate collaboration, knowledge sharing, and future development.

**Council Summary & Plan for Next Round (Reference):**  (This section will be updated at the end of each round.)

*   **Summary of Last Round:** [To be filled by the council].
*   **Blockers/Issues:** [To be filled by the council].
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:** [To be filled by the council].

**Important Notes:**

*   This document serves as a guide, not a rigid set of instructions.
*   The team is encouraged to use their judgment and creativity to interpret and apply these principles within the broader context of the project.
*   Regular review and refinement of these strategic directions are essential for sustained success.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Key Considerations:**

*   **Emphasis on Strategic Guidance:** I've shifted the language to be more high-level and guidance-oriented. Less prescriptive than a list of technical commands.
*   **Incorporated Feedback Loop Focus:** The new version explicitly prioritizes the closed-loop learning and automated self-analysis direction as outlined in `PLAN.md`.
*   **Clearer Structure:** Used section headings and bullet points to enhance readability and organization.
*   **Emphasis on Human Oversight & Team Collaboration:**  Reiterated the importance of human judgment, creativity, and team collaboration.
*   **Maintained Key Principles:**  Retained the core principles from the original prompt, ensuring alignment with the overall project goals.
*   **Placeholder for Council Summary:** Included a dedicated section for the council’s summary and plan, ensuring continuous alignment with current priorities.
* **Removed Specific Task Lists:**  Removed itemized task lists. `PLAN.md` is the place for the next iteration's actions. This keeps the `goal.prompt` focused on the "why" and "what" at a higher level.



**To implement:**  Replace the contents of your existing `goal.prompt` file with the text above.  Remember to replace the bracketed placeholder text with the specifics of your project.  Good luck!
