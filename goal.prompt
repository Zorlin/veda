### Council Round 11 (2025-04-13 10:20:11)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** We're shifting our focus from building Aiderbot’s core functionality to rigorously testing its resilience and reliability. We've confirmed the foundational pieces are solid, and Aiderbot is now capable of learning and adapting from testing. The current priority is to proactively identify and resolve any potential weaknesses before users experience them, ensuring a consistently smooth and dependable experience. We've started stress testing and are actively searching for edge cases.

## Goal: Ensure Aiderbot is Rock-Solid Reliable

**Overall Direction:** Our priority has shifted from initial development to ensuring Aiderbot is exceptionally reliable and performs consistently well under various conditions. We want users to be confident in Aiderbot's stability and performance.

**Key Objectives:**

*   **Proactive Testing:**  Conduct thorough stress testing to identify and fix any weaknesses *before* users encounter them. This includes testing with unusual data, under high load, and in scenarios that mimic real-world use cases.
*   **Graceful Handling of Errors:**  Ensure Aiderbot recovers smoothly from errors and provides clear, helpful messages to the user, minimizing frustration.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Leverage Aiderbot’s ability to learn from testing to proactively identify and address potential issues.
*   **Maintain a User-Centric Approach:** Every change and improvement should be evaluated for its impact on the user experience, focusing on ease of use and confidence.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Execute comprehensive stress testing:**  Focus on edge cases and unusual scenarios.
2.  **Develop robust error handling mechanisms:**  Prioritize clear communication with the user.
3.  **Analyze testing results:**  Identify patterns and areas for improvement.
4.  **Iterate on design and implementation:**  Address identified weaknesses and enhance the user experience.

**Constraints (Refer to README.md for full details):**

*   Adhere to all previously defined high-level goals and limitations.
*   Maintain code quality and test coverage.
*   Prioritize user privacy and security.
