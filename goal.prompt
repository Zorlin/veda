**Project Focus: Proactive Reliability and Continuous Learning**

Our primary focus for this iteration is to shift from reactive error handling to a proactive, learning-driven approach for Aiderbot’s reliability. We're building a system that not only identifies and fixes issues but also anticipates and prevents them.  This aligns with our overarching commitment to quality and a positive user experience, as outlined in README.md.

**Key Objectives:**

* **Establish a Robust Logging System:** Aiderbot will consistently log its experiences, including both successes and failures, to aiderbot.log. This log will be *essential* for the Council’s review and analysis each round.  This data is the foundation of our proactive approach.
* **Root Cause Analysis and Pattern Identification:** The Council will meticulously analyze aiderbot.log to identify recurring error patterns and their root causes. Document these patterns thoroughly – this is how we build our knowledge base.
* **Proactive Testing and Prevention:**  Based on our findings, we’re integrating preventative measures and expanded test coverage into our development workflows.  The goal is to catch potential issues *before* they impact users.
* **Team Troubleshooting and Prevention Guide:**  We're building a living document, easily accessible to the team, outlining common failure patterns, their root causes, and documented preventative measures. This will serve as a central repository of our collective knowledge.
* **Continuous Monitoring & User Feedback:** We will proactively observe user experiences during error scenarios to ensure clarity and ease of recovery, reinforcing trust in Aiderbot.

**Success Measurement:**

* Frequency of previously common failure patterns decreasing.
* Increased coverage of preventative measures within our automated testing suite.
* Consistent and accessible Team Troubleshooting and Prevention Guide usage and updates.
* Positive user feedback regarding error handling and recovery processes.

This shift ensures we are continuously improving the reliability and user experience of Aiderbot, maintaining alignment with our overarching goals and commitment to quality.  Our focus is on *learning* from our experiences and building a system that gets better and more reliable over time.
