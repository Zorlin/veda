You are improving aiderbot according to the information laid out in README.md

Look for anything missing, any tests that can be added, anything you can do to make it run unstoppably and controllably

And expand on the concepts used if needed

You should:
1. Make Live Aider Output respect Aider's control codes (like \c for cancel)
2. Prevent text duplication in both the Live Log and Diff Viewers
3. Keep the Live Log focused on current state and recent activity
4. Implement a working interrupt system that actually stops Aider
5. Respect changes to goal.prompt even after initial run if they're edited

You should make sure:
- All output follows proper formatting control codes
- Diffs are displayed with clear syntax highlighting
- The Live Log only shows relevant, non-duplicated activity
- Interrupt process sends proper signals and cleans up resources
- Goal changes trigger reinitialization of Aider with new instructions
