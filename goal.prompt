### Council Round 12 (2025-04-13 10:42:48)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** The team has moved from building Aiderbot’s foundation to making sure it’s truly dependable in everyday use. We’re now focused on making Aiderbot strong enough to handle surprises and recover smoothly if something goes wrong. Our recent work has shown that Aiderbot can learn from its own tests, which helps us spot and fix problems before they reach users. The next step is to keep looking for weak spots and make improvements before anyone runs into trouble.
*   **Blockers/Issues:** No major blockers at the moment. We’re keeping an eye on stress testing to catch any hidden issues. One thing we could do better is to write down common failure scenarios, so it’s easier to fix things quickly when they happen.
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Keep Stress Testing:** Keep pushing Aiderbot with tough and unusual situations, especially those we haven’t tried before.
    *   [ ] **Make Recovery Smoother:** Make sure that when something goes wrong, Aiderbot explains what happened and helps users get back on track without confusion.
    *   [ ] **Write a Troubleshooting Guide:** Start a simple guide for the team that lists common problems and how to fix them, so we can solve issues faster.
    *   [ ] **Check the User Experience:** Take a fresh look at what it’s like for users when things go wrong, and make sure it feels clear and reassuring.
*   **Reference:** This plan must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

goal.prompt:

"Your primary goal is to ensure Aiderbot is a reliably helpful assistant. Focus on robustness and graceful recovery from errors.  Specifically, prioritize the following:

*   **Find and fix weaknesses:**  Actively seek out ways Aiderbot might fail or behave unexpectedly, especially in unusual or stressful situations.
*   **Communicate clearly during interruptions:** When Aiderbot encounters a problem, provide users with clear explanations and easy recovery options.
*   **Learn from failures:**  Document common failure points so we can quickly resolve issues and prevent them from recurring.

Remember that a user's trust in Aiderbot depends on its ability to consistently provide a positive experience, even when things don’t go perfectly."

### Human comments:
* We should add logging to Aiderbot so it improves each run.
