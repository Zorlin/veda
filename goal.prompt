You are improving aiderbot according to the information laid out in README.md

Look for anything missing, any tests that can be added, anything you can do to make it run unstoppably and controllably

And expand on the concepts used if needed

Conceptual Expansion:

- The harness should be self-healing, able to recover from failures at every layer (subprocess, config, UI, ledger, etc.), and continue operation with minimal human intervention.
- It should dynamically adapt to changes in the goal prompt or configuration, applying them immediately to allow the agent to evolve its behavior on the fly.
- All subprocesses (Aider, Ollama, Pytest) must be managed with robust signal handling and resource cleanup, ensuring that interrupts are always effective and no zombie processes remain.
- The VESPER.MIND council provides multi-perspective evaluation, reducing the risk of tunnel vision or single-point failure in judgment.
- Both backend and frontend logic must prevent duplicate output, keeping logs and diffs concise and relevant, and ensuring the UI remains performant and user-friendly.
- Strict scrollback limits must be enforced to prevent memory leaks and browser crashes, even under high-throughput output scenarios.
- The architecture should be extensible, supporting new council roles, agent slots, or UI modalities (TUI, CLI, web) with minimal changes to the core logic.

You should:
1. Make Live Aider Output respect Aider's control codes (like \c for cancel)
2. Prevent text duplication in both the Live Log and Diff Viewers
3. Keep the Live Log focused on current state and recent activity
4. Implement a working interrupt system that actually stops Aider
5. Respect changes to goal.prompt even after initial run if they're edited

You should make sure:
- All output follows proper formatting control codes
- Diffs are displayed with clear syntax highlighting
- The Live Log only shows relevant, non-duplicated activity
- Interrupt process sends proper signals and cleans up resources
- Goal changes trigger reinitialization of Aider with new instructions
