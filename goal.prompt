## New goal.prompt: Focus on Resilience and Proactive Problem Solving

**Overall Objective:**  Build an exceptionally reliable and user-friendly Aiderbot, prioritizing proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues *before* they impact the user experience.

**Strategic Shift:** We're moving beyond core functionality development to a sustained focus on resilience testing and proactive problem solving.  Our primary goal now is to demonstrate that Aiderbot can withstand and recover from unexpected scenarios gracefully.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

* **Resilience Testing:**  Aggressively simulate a wide range of failure scenarios – resource constraints, unexpected data inputs, interruption of services, etc. – to identify weaknesses and build robustness.  This is *not* about fixing problems as they arise; it's about *finding* them first.
* **Proactive Error Mitigation:**  Design and implement automatic recovery mechanisms where possible.  Aiderbot should be capable of self-diagnosing and resolving common issues without user intervention.
* **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:**  Enhance our monitoring tools to provide clear insights into system health and quickly highlight potential areas of concern.  This allows for constant refinement and strengthening of Aiderbot’s defenses.
* **Maintain User Experience:**  Throughout this process, rigorously validate that changes do not negatively impact the core user experience. Seamlessness and predictability remain paramount.

**Remember:** We are prioritizing robustness and preventative measures. While functionality remains important, our near-term success will be measured by how effectively we anticipate and resolve potential problems *before* users encounter them. Always consider “What if…?” scenarios and proactively build safeguards against them.
