## New goal.prompt

**Overall Project Goal:** Deliver a robust and reliable AI assistant (Aiderbot) that empowers users to achieve their goals efficiently and enjoyably, all while maintaining a focus on safety and user well-being.

**Current Phase Focus: Proactive Reliability & Stability**

For the next development cycle, our primary focus shifts from feature development to **proactive reliability and stability**.  We're moving into a phase of rigorous testing and preventative measures to ensure Aiderbot functions consistently and gracefully, even under challenging conditions.  This is *not* about adding new capabilities; it's about strengthening the foundation we’ve built.

**Key Directives:**

* **"Break it to Fix it":**  Actively design and execute stress tests, edge-case simulations, and failure mode analyses. Intentionally try to trigger errors and identify vulnerabilities in the system's architecture, prompt design, and error handling.
* **Seamless User Experience During Recovery:**  Focus on how Aiderbot responds to unexpected events.  Prioritize graceful degradation and clear, understandable feedback to the user, minimizing frustration and preserving progress whenever possible. Interruptions should feel like natural pauses, not jarring failures.
* **Prompt Safety and Robustness:** Any modifications to the core prompts used by Aiderbot must be subjected to heightened scrutiny. This includes thorough testing for unintended consequences, biases, and vulnerabilities to adversarial input.
* **Automated Error Correction:**  Explore and implement mechanisms for Aiderbot to automatically detect, diagnose, and correct common errors, reducing the need for manual intervention.
* **Enhanced Observability:** Improve our monitoring and logging capabilities to gain deeper insights into Aiderbot’s internal state and quickly identify and resolve emerging issues.

**Remember:** This phase is about building confidence in Aiderbot’s ability to deliver a consistently positive user experience. Prioritize stability and resilience over rapid feature additions.  Always defer to the high-level goals and constraints documented in README.md.
