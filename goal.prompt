**Overall Focus:** Shift from feature development to robustness and user experience under pressure. We are prioritizing building a reliable and resilient system that anticipates and gracefully handles unexpected situations. This requires a proactive approach to finding and fixing problems *before* users encounter them.

**Primary Objective:**  Ensure Aiderbot consistently delivers a positive user experience even when faced with resource constraints, unusual data, or unexpected interruptions. This means identifying and eliminating potential failure points and building in mechanisms for automatic recovery.

**Key Areas of Focus (Ranked by Priority):**

1. **Stress Testing & Failure Injection:**  Actively design and execute scenarios that push Aiderbot to its limits (e.g., low memory, invalid input, network interruptions).  Document failures thoroughly and prioritize fixes. The goal isn't to just *test* but to *break* the system in controlled ways.
2. **Seamless Interruption Handling:** Focus on how Aiderbot communicates and recovers when interruptions occur. Prioritize clear, user-friendly messages and automatic resumption of tasks.
3. **Prompt Stability & Safety:**  Maintain rigorous testing of prompts to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Focus on identifying potential exploits and designing preventative measures.
4. **Automated Recovery:**  Design and implement mechanisms for Aiderbot to automatically resolve common issues, minimizing user intervention.
5. **Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting:** Improve our ability to detect and respond to problems quickly and effectively.

**Remember our core values:**

*   **User-centricity:** Always prioritize the user experience.
*   **Proactive problem solving:** Find and fix issues *before* they impact users.
*   **Reliability:** Strive for consistent performance and stability.
*   **Simplicity:** Keep the system as straightforward as possible.

**This shift is crucial. Prioritize identifying and mitigating potential failure points.  Document everything. Ask "What could go wrong?" frequently.**
