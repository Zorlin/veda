### Council Round 3 (2025-04-12 18:25:46)
*   **Summary of Last Round:**  The previous round focused on implementing core control features like interrupt handling, control code processing in live output, and dynamic goal prompt reloading.  Significant progress was made in enhancing the robustness and controllability of Aiderbot.  We implemented the beginnings of preventing duplicate messages and focused the live log.
*   **Blockers/Issues:**
    *   **Rudimentary Control Code Parsing:** The current control code parsing is simplistic and relies on string matching.  More sophisticated parsing and validation are needed to prevent unintended consequences.
    *   **UI Synchronization:**  The duplicate output prevention mechanism requires corresponding changes to the UI to effectively respect the chunk cache.  Currently, only back end prevention occurs.
    *   **Robustness of Error Recovery:**  The error recovery logic is currently limited to adding "run cargo test" to the instructions. More advanced error diagnosis and remediation strategies are needed.
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Enhance Control Code Parsing:** Implement a more robust parser that can handle a wider range of control codes and perform validation.
    *   [ ] **Synchronize UI with Chunk Cache:** Update the UI to respect the chunk cache and prevent duplicate output rendering.
    *   [ ] **Implement Advanced Error Diagnosis:** Introduce more sophisticated error diagnosis and remediation capabilities, potentially using LLMs to analyze error logs and suggest fixes.
    *   [ ] **Improve System Logging:** Standardize and enhance the logging system to provide more detailed and actionable information.
*   **Reference:** This plan must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

### Council Round 4 (2025-04-12 18:32:18)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** This round focused on refining the core architecture for Aiderbot, emphasizing live output control code respect, duplicate prevention in the UI (Live Log & Diff Viewers), and enabling dynamic goal prompt updates during runtime.  Significant effort was dedicated to enhancing the interrupt mechanism for reliable Aider process termination and resource cleanup.  The initial implementation successfully demonstrated these functionalities, although further refinement is needed to ensure reliability across various failure scenarios. Tests have passed, but the focus now shifts to comprehensive stress testing.
*   **Blockers/Issues:**
    * **Limited Stress Testing:** The current testing suite doesn't adequately simulate real-world failure conditions (e.g., resource exhaustion, network interruptions, malformed test output). This limits confidence in the system's resilience.
    * **Interrupt Mechanism Refinement:** While functional, the interrupt mechanism needs to be rigorously tested across a wider range of failure states to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.  Specifically, handling edge cases where Aider is in the middle of a complex operation is critical.
    * **Dynamic Goal Prompt Updates:** The implementation of dynamic goal prompt updates requires careful validation to avoid unintended consequences or conflicts with the core Aider logic.
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Stress Testing:** Design and execute a robust stress testing suite that simulates diverse failure conditions (resource exhaustion, network disruptions, malformed test output, etc.). *Priority: High*
    *   [ ] **Refine Interrupt Mechanism:** Thoroughly test the interrupt mechanism across a wide range of failure states.  Focus on edge cases where Aider is in the middle of complex operations (e.g., compiling, running tests). *Priority: High*
    *   [ ] **Validate Dynamic Goal Prompt Updates:** Conduct rigorous validation of dynamic goal prompt updates to ensure stability and prevent unintended consequences. Include negative testing (intentional corruption of prompts). *Priority: Medium*
    *   [ ] **Develop Self-Healing Capabilities:** Implement strategies for automatic recovery from common failures, such as restarting subprocesses or re-running failed tests. *Priority: Medium*
    *   [ ] **Improve Logging and Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to provide greater visibility into the system's internal state and facilitate debugging. *Priority: Low*
*   **Reference:** This plan must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

### Council Round 5 (2025-04-12 18:34:02)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** This round focused on solidifying the core functionality of Aiderbot, particularly around dynamic goal prompts and reliable interrupt handling. We’ve made significant strides in these areas and successfully passed initial tests, but we need to ensure stability and robustness under more challenging conditions. The team also worked on improving how Aiderbot deals with potential errors and interruptions in real-world scenarios.

### Council Round 6 (2025-04-12 18:59:11)
* **Summary of Last Round:** We're seeing positive results with dynamic goal prompts and reliable interruption handling. We're confident in the core functionality, but need to push the system harder to ensure it can recover gracefully from unexpected problems in real-world use.

* **Next Steps:**
    * **Stress Test the System:** We need a comprehensive test suite that simulates typical and edge-case failures – things like running out of resources, network problems, and bad data from tests. *Priority: High*
    * **Refine Interruption Handling:** The interruption mechanism works well, but needs more testing to make sure it always cleans up properly, especially when Aiderbot is in the middle of something complicated. *Priority: High*
    * **Validate Dynamic Goal Prompts:** Let's be sure that changes to the instructions don’t cause any unexpected problems with how Aiderbot works. Include testing that intentionally tries to "break" the prompts. *Priority: Medium*
    * **Build Self-Healing Features:** Let's explore ways for Aiderbot to automatically recover from common issues, like restarting failed processes or re-running tests. *Priority: Medium*
    * **Improve Monitoring & Logging:** We need better tools to see what's going on inside Aiderbot and make it easier to fix problems. *Priority: Low*

### Council Round 7 (2025-04-12 19:13:48)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** We've made solid progress on dynamic goal prompts and reliable interruption handling, which are now functioning as intended.  Our focus has been on building the foundation for a truly resilient AI assistant. We're now at a critical stage where we need to rigorously test the system under a wide range of stressful conditions to ensure stability and graceful recovery from errors. Initial testing is passing, but we're now shifting towards a more adversarial testing approach.

### Council Round 8 (2025-04-12 19:34:36)
* **Summary of Last Round:** We've built the core functionality for Aiderbot: dynamic goal prompts and reliable interruption handling. Now, we need to make sure it's truly robust and can handle unexpected problems in the real world.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Stress Test Thoroughly:** We need to push Aiderbot to its limits with a wide range of challenging scenarios – simulating resource exhaustion, network interruptions, and problematic test data.  *Priority: High*
2. **Solidify Interruption Handling:** Ensure the interruption mechanism always cleans up properly, even when Aiderbot is working on complex tasks. *Priority: High*
3. **Validate Dynamic Goal Prompts:**  Make sure changes to instructions don't cause unexpected issues with Aiderbot's operation. We need to intentionally try to "break" prompts to identify vulnerabilities. *Priority: Medium*
4. **Build in Self-Healing:** Explore options for Aiderbot to automatically recover from common errors, like restarting processes or re-running tests. *Priority: Medium*
5. **Improve Visibility:** Enhance our logging and monitoring tools to provide better insights into Aiderbot's internal workings, making debugging easier. *Priority: Low*
