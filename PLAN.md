This document is collaboratively updated by the open source council at each round.
It contains the current, actionable plan for the next iteration(s) of the agent harness.

- A human may optionally update PLAN.MD as needed but is never required to
- The council should update this file frequently to reflect new strategies, priorities, and next steps.
- The council should only update `goal.prompt` when a major shift in overall direction is needed (rare).
- All plans must always respect the high-level goals and constraints set out in `README.md`.
