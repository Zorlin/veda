This document is collaboratively updated by the open source council at each round.
It contains the current, actionable plan for the next iteration(s) of the agent harness.

- The council should update this file frequently to reflect new strategies, priorities, and next steps.
- The council should only update `goal.prompt` when a major shift in overall direction is needed (rare).
- All plans must always respect the high-level goals and constraints set out in `README.md`.

## Current Plan

- [x] The open source council will convene at the end of each round to collaboratively review and update this PLAN.md file, ensuring it reflects the most current actionable steps, strategies, and next steps for the agent harness.
- [x] The council will only update goal.prompt if a significant change in overall direction is required (rare).
- [x] All planning and actions must always respect the high-level goals and constraints set out in README.md.
- [ ] For the next round:
    - Review the results and outcomes of the previous iteration.
    - Identify any blockers, missing features, or areas needing improvement.
    - Assign clear, actionable tasks for the next iteration (e.g., implement new tests, improve robustness, enhance council evaluation logic).
    - Ensure that all changes and plans are documented here for transparency and traceability.
    - Confirm that the plan aligns with the high-level goals in README.md and does not diverge from the project's core direction.
