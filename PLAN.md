# Veda Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for Veda, a meta-agent system that orchestrates AI agents (primarily using Aider) to assist with software development through an intuitive terminal user interface (TUI).

## Project Goals
Based on the README.md, Veda aims to:
1. Provide a user-centric Terminal User Interface (TUI) as the primary interaction method
2. Integrate AI within the UI for intelligent assistance
3. Seamlessly manage Aider instances in the background
4. Orchestrate multiple AI agents to work on development tasks
5. Maintain user control throughout the development process

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Set up project structure and dependencies
- [ ] Implement basic TUI framework using Textual
- [ ] Create agent manager for handling Aider instances
- [ ] Develop configuration management system
- [ ] Implement Ollama client for internal reasoning

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Implement goal parsing and file awareness
- [ ] Develop planning phase using DeepCoder:14B via Ollama
- [ ] Create Aider worker spawning mechanism
- [ ] Implement GPU queue management
- [ ] Develop worker status tracking and logging

### Phase 3: User Interface Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Implement tabbed interface for agent monitoring
- [ ] Create home screen with agent overview
- [ ] Develop broadcast messaging to all workers
- [ ] Implement user input handling and command processing
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and help documentation

### Phase 4: Integration and Workflow (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Implement file reading and context injection
- [ ] Develop JSON schema for goal.prompt, goal.plan.json, and worker logs
- [ ] Create workflow directory structure
- [ ] Implement detach functionality (Ctrl+D)
- [ ] Add session persistence

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform user testing and gather feedback
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Document code and create user guide

## Technical Dependencies
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Ollama (for internal chat and coordination)
- Aider (as the primary coding engine)
- OpenRouter API (for accessing advanced models)

## JSON Schema Layouts

### goal.prompt
```json
{
  "goal": "Description of the user's goal",
  "mentioned_files": ["file1.py", "file2.py"]
}
```

### goal.plan.json
```json
{
  "strategy": "Overall approach description",
  "tasks": [
    { "file": "file1.py", "action": "Description of changes" }
  ]
}
```

### workflows/worker-N.json
```json
{
  "worker": "worker-N",
  "status": "editing|waiting|complete",
  "file": "current_file.py",
  "summary": "Description of current work",
  "dependencies": ["dependent_file.py"]
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Challenges
1. **GPU Resource Management**: Ensuring efficient use of GPU resources when multiple agents need access
2. **Agent Coordination**: Preventing conflicts when multiple agents work on related files
3. **User Experience**: Maintaining intuitive UX while providing comprehensive control
4. **Model Performance**: Ensuring consistent performance across different LLM models

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement robust GPU queue with priority system
2. Develop dependency tracking between worker tasks
3. Conduct regular usability testing of the TUI
4. Include fallback options for different model configurations

## Success Criteria
- TUI provides clear visibility into agent activities
- Users can effectively control and guide the development process
- Agents successfully coordinate to complete complex development tasks
- System handles file dependencies and conflicts gracefully
- Performance remains responsive even with multiple agents active

## Future Enhancements (Post v1.0)
- Enhanced project analysis capabilities
- Integration with additional coding tools beyond Aider
- Support for collaborative development with multiple users
- Advanced visualization of agent activities and dependencies
- Customizable agent personalities and specializations
