### Council Round 4 (2025-04-12 18:32:18)
*   **Summary of Last Round:** This round focused on refining the core architecture for Aiderbot, emphasizing live output control code respect, duplicate prevention in the UI (Live Log & Diff Viewers), and enabling dynamic goal prompt updates during runtime.  Significant effort was dedicated to enhancing the interrupt mechanism for reliable Aider process termination and resource cleanup.  The initial implementation successfully demonstrated these functionalities, although further refinement is needed to ensure reliability across various failure scenarios. Tests have passed, but the focus now shifts to comprehensive stress testing.
*   **Blockers/Issues:**
    * **Limited Stress Testing:** The current testing suite doesn't adequately simulate real-world failure conditions (e.g., resource exhaustion, network interruptions, malformed test output). This limits confidence in the system's resilience.
    * **Interrupt Mechanism Refinement:** While functional, the interrupt mechanism needs to be rigorously tested across a wider range of failure states to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.  Specifically, handling edge cases where Aider is in the middle of a complex operation is critical.
    * **Dynamic Goal Prompt Updates:** The implementation of dynamic goal prompt updates requires careful validation to avoid unintended consequences or conflicts with the core Aider logic.
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Implement Comprehensive Stress Testing:** Design and execute a robust stress testing suite that simulates diverse failure conditions (resource exhaustion, network disruptions, malformed test output, etc.). *Priority: High*
    *   [ ] **Refine Interrupt Mechanism:** Thoroughly test the interrupt mechanism across a wide range of failure states.  Focus on edge cases where Aider is in the middle of complex operations (e.g., compiling, running tests). *Priority: High*
    *   [ ] **Validate Dynamic Goal Prompt Updates:** Conduct rigorous validation of dynamic goal prompt updates to ensure stability and prevent unintended consequences. Include negative testing (intentional corruption of prompts). *Priority: Medium*
    *   [ ] **Develop Self-Healing Capabilities:** Implement strategies for automatic recovery from common failures, such as restarting subprocesses or re-running failed tests. *Priority: Medium*
    *   [ ] **Improve Logging and Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to provide greater visibility into the system's internal state and facilitate debugging. *Priority: Low*
*   **Reference:** This plan must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.

---

### Council Round 6 (2025-04-12 18:59:11)
* **Summary of Last Round:** We're seeing positive results with dynamic goal prompts and reliable interruption handling. We're confident in the core functionality, but need to push the system harder to ensure it can recover gracefully from unexpected problems in real-world use.

* **Next Steps:**
    * **Stress Test the System:** We need a comprehensive test suite that simulates typical and edge-case failures – things like running out of resources, network problems, and bad data from tests. *Priority: High*
    * **Refine Interruption Handling:** The interruption mechanism works well, but needs more testing to make sure it always cleans up properly, especially when Aiderbot is in the middle of something complicated. *Priority: High*
    * **Validate Dynamic Goal Prompts:** Let's be sure that changes to the instructions don’t cause any unexpected problems with how Aiderbot works. Include testing that intentionally tries to "break" the prompts. *Priority: Medium*
    * **Build Self-Healing Features:** Let's explore ways for Aiderbot to automatically recover from common issues, like restarting failed processes or re-running tests. *Priority: Medium*
    * **Improve Monitoring & Logging:** We need better tools to see what's going on inside Aiderbot and make it easier to fix problems. *Priority: Low*
