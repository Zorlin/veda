## goal.prompt

**Overall Mission:** Build a robust and reliable AI assistant capable of guiding software development tasks even in the face of unexpected errors and interruptions.

**Key Priorities (Next Phase):**

* **Stress Testing & Resilience:** Our immediate focus is on making Aiderbot *unbreakable*. We need to intentionally break it, identify vulnerabilities, and build in mechanisms for automatic recovery. This means creating a comprehensive suite of stress tests that simulate a wide range of failure scenarios: resource exhaustion, network issues, malformed test data, and more.  Document the results of these tests and prioritize fixes.
* **Proactive Stability:**  Moving beyond simply fixing errors, we aim to *prevent* them. This means implementing robust error handling, validating inputs rigorously, and building in safeguards to protect against common pitfalls.  Focus on designing for failure.
* **Maintain Core Functionality:** As we build robustness, it’s critical to ensure that our core abilities – dynamic goal prompting and reliable interruption handling – remain reliable and performant. Regression testing is essential.

**Guiding Principles:**

* **Fail Fast, Learn Quickly:**  Embrace experimentation and view failures as opportunities for learning and improvement.
* **Prioritize Reliability:** Stability is paramount.  New features should not compromise the existing functionality.
* **Automate Where Possible:** Minimize manual intervention in testing and recovery processes.

**Remember:** We're not just building an AI assistant; we're building a *trusted* AI assistant.  This requires unwavering commitment to quality, reliability, and user experience.

## Goal.prompt

**Overall Direction:** Shift from feature development (dynamic prompts, reliable interruption) to rigorous system hardening and resilience testing. We're aiming for a robust and reliable AI assistant that gracefully handles unexpected issues.  Think "break it to fix it."

**Priorities:**

1. **Resilience & Stability Testing (Highest Priority):**  Dedicated effort to identify and fix weaknesses through aggressive and realistic testing. This is *more* important than adding new features.  Focus on scenarios involving resource exhaustion, network failures, and malformed data.  Establish metrics for graceful degradation and recovery.

2. **Interruption Handling Refinement:** Ensure the interruption mechanism not only functions correctly but also reliably cleans up after itself, even during complex operations. This includes thorough testing of edge cases and potential resource leaks.

3. **Dynamic Prompt Validation:**  Continue to refine and validate the dynamic prompt system, actively seeking vulnerabilities and ensuring that changes to instructions do not introduce unexpected behaviors or instability.

4. **Self-Healing Capabilities Exploration:** Investigate and prototype automated recovery mechanisms for common errors, such as process restarts and test re-executions. Prioritize solutions that minimize human intervention.

**Constraints & Considerations:**

*   All actions must remain aligned with the high-level goals defined in README.md (e.g., safety, accuracy, helpfulness).
*   Avoid adding significant new features until core system resilience is demonstrably improved.
*   Maintain thorough documentation of testing procedures and identified vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly review and update testing protocols to reflect evolving risks and potential failure modes.

**Key Question:** *How can we proactively break our system to make it stronger?*

## goal.prompt

**Overall Direction: Build a Robust and Self-Healing AI Assistant**

Our primary focus is now on creating an AI assistant, Aiderbot, that is exceptionally reliable and capable of gracefully handling unexpected failures. We're moving beyond simply building features to actively *strengthening* the system's resilience.  This means proactively finding and fixing weaknesses *before* they impact users.  Think of it as stress-testing the system to make it stronger, not just measuring its current capabilities.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Resilience First:** Every design and implementation decision should consider its impact on the system's ability to recover from errors.
*   **Proactive Failure Testing:** We will actively seek to break the system to identify and address vulnerabilities. This isn't about finding fault, it's about ensuring robust performance.
*   **Automatic Improvement:** When failures occur, the system should automatically update its guidance (this prompt) to prioritize fixing the root cause, ensuring we're constantly learning and improving.
*   **User-Centric Stability:**  Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and dependable experience for the user.  Resilience directly contributes to this.

**Next Steps (Prioritized):**

1.  **Simulate Real-World Failures:**  Develop and execute a comprehensive suite of tests simulating various failure scenarios: resource exhaustion, network outages, data corruption, unexpected input.
2.  **Enhance Interruption Handling:**  Ensure all interruptions are handled cleanly, preserving state and allowing for seamless resumption of tasks.
3.  **Prompt Stability & Verification:**  Thoroughly test the impact of any modifications to this prompt (goal.prompt) to prevent regressions and ensure continued stability.
4.  **Automated Recovery:** Implement mechanisms that allow Aiderbot to automatically recover from common errors, minimizing human intervention.  Think self-healing capabilities.
5. **Increase Observability:** Improve logging, monitoring and alerting to quickly detect and diagnose issues that occur in production.

**Crucially, remember that all actions must align with the high-level goals and constraints documented in README.md, particularly the emphasis on building a system that is exceptionally reliable, even under duress.**

This shift in focus represents a significant change in direction. It's not enough to simply build features; we must build a system that thrives when faced with adversity.  Let's build a truly robust and self-healing AI assistant.

```

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` designed to reflect the shift in direction, maintain alignment with the high-level goals, and guide the team effectively.  I've focused on clear direction and strategic focus, as requested.

```
**GOAL: Build a Resilient and Reliable AI Assistant**

**Overall Strategy:** Our primary objective is to engineer a robust AI assistant, "AiderBot," capable of consistently delivering a positive user experience *even when faced with unexpected errors or challenging conditions.*  We will achieve this through proactive vulnerability testing and automated self-correction.

**Critical Principles (Always adhere to these):**

*   **User-Centricity:**  Every decision must prioritize a seamless and reliable experience for the user.  Frustration due to errors is unacceptable.
*   **Proactive Resilience:**  We will *actively seek to break* the system. This isn't about finding excuses for failure; it's about deliberately uncovering weaknesses and building solutions.
*   **Automated Correction:** When errors *do* occur, we will prioritize automated recovery and self-correction over manual intervention.  The user should not notice the hiccup.

**Key Focus Areas for Next Phase:**

1.  **Aggressive Stress Testing:**  Simulate a wide range of real-world failure scenarios, including:
    *   Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)
    *   Network instability and outages
    *   Corrupted or malformed data inputs
    *   Unexpected user behavior

2.  **Automated Recovery Mechanisms:**  Implement systems that automatically detect and correct errors, such as:
    *   Component restarts
    *   Data validation and cleansing
    *   Fallback procedures for critical functionalities

3.  **Prompt Stability & Security:** Continuously evaluate the stability and security of the goal prompts against malicious or unintended behaviors. Ensure prompts don't inadvertently create unpredictable results or vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Monitoring & Learning:**  Establish comprehensive monitoring tools to track system health and identify potential failure points.  Use this data to continuously improve resilience.

**Important Reminder:**  The overarching goal is *not* to eliminate errors entirely (that's impossible). It is to design a system that *handles* errors gracefully, minimizes disruption to the user, and automatically recovers whenever possible. Document all testing procedures and findings meticulously.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Considerations:**

*   **Explicit Resilience Focus:** The prompt directly emphasizes "resilience" and "handling" errors.
*   **Proactive Vulnerability Testing:** This is a core directive—actively trying to break the system.
*   **Automated Correction:** A major shift towards self-healing capabilities.
*   **Simplified Language:**  I'm using clear, high-level language rather than technical jargon.
*   **Reminders/Principles:**  I’m including principles at the start to reinforce the core strategy.
*   **Specific Focus Areas:** This provides direction on *what* to prioritize in the next phase.
*   **Document everything:**  Highlights the need for proper documentation.
* **Prompt Stability & Security:** Addressed a newly recognized vulnerability that wasn't in previous prompts.



This new `goal.prompt` is designed to be a guiding document that sets the overall strategic direction for the team, focusing on building a robust and user-friendly AI assistant.

When all tests pass, we want to keep going with the new direction and run Aider again, not just gracefully exit. Aiderbot should be designed to run 24x7.

---


Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` designed to reflect the shift in direction, maintain alignment with the high-level goals, and guide the team effectively.  I've focused on clear direction and strategic focus, as requested.

```
**GOAL: Build a Resilient and Reliable AI Assistant**

**Overall Strategy:** Our primary objective is to engineer a robust AI assistant, "AiderBot," capable of consistently delivering a positive user experience *even when faced with unexpected errors or challenging conditions.*  We will achieve this through proactive vulnerability testing and automated self-correction.

**Critical Principles (Always adhere to these):**

*   **User-Centricity:**  Every decision must prioritize a seamless and reliable experience for the user.  Frustration due to errors is unacceptable.
*   **Proactive Resilience:**  We will *actively seek to break* the system. This isn't about finding excuses for failure; it's about deliberately uncovering weaknesses and building solutions.
*   **Automated Correction:** When errors *do* occur, we will prioritize automated recovery and self-correction over manual intervention.  The user should not notice the hiccup.

**Key Focus Areas for Next Phase:**

1.  **Aggressive Stress Testing:**  Simulate a wide range of real-world failure scenarios, including:
    *   Resource exhaustion (memory, CPU)
    *   Network instability and outages
    *   Corrupted or malformed data inputs
    *   Unexpected user behavior

2.  **Automated Recovery Mechanisms:**  Implement systems that automatically detect and correct errors, such as:
    *   Component restarts
    *   Data validation and cleansing
    *   Fallback procedures for critical functionalities

3.  **Prompt Stability & Security:** Continuously evaluate the stability and security of the goal prompts against malicious or unintended behaviors. Ensure prompts don't inadvertently create unpredictable results or vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Monitoring & Learning:**  Establish comprehensive monitoring tools to track system health and identify potential failure points.  Use this data to continuously improve resilience.

**Important Reminder:**  The overarching goal is *not* to eliminate errors entirely (that's impossible). It is to design a system that *handles* errors gracefully, minimizes disruption to the user, and automatically recovers whenever possible. Document all testing procedures and findings meticulously.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Considerations:**

*   **Explicit Resilience Focus:** The prompt directly emphasizes "resilience" and "handling" errors.
*   **Proactive Vulnerability Testing:** This is a core directive—actively trying to break the system.
*   **Automated Correction:** A major shift towards self-healing capabilities.
*   **Simplified Language:**  I'm using clear, high-level language rather than technical jargon.
*   **Reminders/Principles:**  I’m including principles at the start to reinforce the core strategy.
*   **Specific Focus Areas:** This provides direction on *what* to prioritize in the next phase.
*   **Document everything:**  Highlights the need for proper documentation.
* **Prompt Stability & Security:** Addressed a newly recognized vulnerability that wasn't in previous prompts.



This new `goal.prompt` is designed to be a guiding document that sets the overall strategic direction for the team, focusing on building a robust and user-friendly AI assistant.

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a new `goal.prompt` based on the provided information, designed to reflect the strategic shift towards proactive resilience and continuous improvement.  It's written as high-level guidance.

```
## Goal.Prompt: Aiderbot - Focus on Resilience & Continuous Improvement

**Overall Direction:**  Our primary focus is now building a demonstrably resilient and continuously improving Aiderbot. We are shifting from reactive problem-solving to *proactive* identification and mitigation of potential failures. This means actively seeking to "break" the system and rigorously testing its ability to recover gracefully and adapt to changing conditions.  Maintaining a positive and reliable user experience remains paramount.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity:**  View failures during testing as valuable data points, not setbacks.  Thoroughly analyze failures to understand root causes and implement preventative measures.
*   **Proactive Stress Testing:**  Prioritize rigorous stress testing under a wide range of adverse conditions. Simulate resource exhaustion, network disruptions, and data corruption. Go beyond nominal scenarios.
*   **Continuous Adaptation:**  Ensure the system is designed to adapt and improve based on ongoing testing and user feedback.  The automated prompt update mechanism is vital; use it to reflect lessons learned.
*   **Graceful Degradation:**  When failures *do* occur (and they will), focus on ensuring the system degrades gracefully. Prioritize maintaining core functionality even under duress.
*   **User-Centricity:**  All decisions must be evaluated through the lens of the user experience.  Reliability and predictability are paramount.

**Key Priorities (Next Phase):**

1.  **Resilience Testing Blitz:** Conduct a concentrated effort to stress-test Aiderbot, actively attempting to trigger failures and observing recovery. Document findings meticulously.
2.  **Interrupt Handling Refinement:**  Focus specifically on ensuring interrupt handling is robust and predictable across diverse system states.
3.  **Prompt Resilience & Adaptation:**  Utilize automated prompt updates to embed resilience best practices and adapt to evolving system complexities. The prompt should actively *reflect* the lessons learned from testing.
4.  **Graceful Degradation Strategy:** Develop and implement strategies for graceful degradation during failure scenarios, minimizing user impact.

**Remember:**  This isn't just about fixing bugs; it’s about designing a system that anticipates and withstands them. The success of Aiderbot hinges on its ability to reliably serve users, even when faced with unforeseen challenges.
```

**Explanation of Choices and Alignment with the Given Context:**

*   **Significant Shift:** The prompt directly addresses the stated shift from reactive to proactive resilience.  The phrases "actively attempting to 'break' the system" and "designed to anticipate and withstand them" highlight this change.
*   **README.md Alignment:** The prompt emphasizes “reliability” and a “positive user experience,” aligning with likely goals in a project's README.
*   **Actionable Guidance:** The "Key Priorities" section provides clear next steps for the development team.
*   **Preservation of Core Instructions:** The original prompt likely emphasized functionality and user satisfaction. This revised prompt retains that focus while adding a critical layer of resilience.
*   **Project Evolution:**  The prompt acknowledges and builds upon the progress detailed in the PLAN.md documents, particularly the introduction and usage of automated prompt updates.
*   **Plain Language:** The language is intended to be easily understood by a human team, avoiding technical jargon.
*   **Conciseness and Focus:**  The prompt is designed to be brief and to-the-point, avoiding unnecessary details.

## Goal.Prompt: Fortify Aiderbot - Prioritize Resilience and Proactive Vulnerability Discovery

**Our Primary Objective:** To build a supremely reliable and user-friendly Aiderbot, capable of gracefully handling unexpected errors and maintaining a seamless user experience.

**Strategic Shift:** We are moving from primarily focused on foundational functionality to a concentrated effort on proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. We will embrace a “break it to fix it” mentality, actively testing the system’s limits and ensuring robust error handling.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Aggressive Testing:** Design and execute rigorous stress tests simulating a wide range of potential failures - resource limitations, network instability, unexpected data inputs, and more. Prioritize finding *edge cases* that can expose weaknesses.  Assume failures will occur and build to handle them.
* **Automated Resilience:** Investigate and implement automated recovery mechanisms. Focus on solutions that allow Aiderbot to detect, diagnose, and automatically correct errors with minimal user intervention.  The user shouldn’s be aware that anything went wrong.
* **Prompt Stability & Proactive Review:** Any changes to the goal.prompt or underlying system should be subjected to a focused "break it" test before deployment.  Assume the change *will* introduce an issue.
* **Continuous Learning:** Closely monitor error logs and performance data to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement.  Treat every failure as a learning opportunity.

**Maintain Alignment with Core Principles:**

* **User-Centricity:**  Always prioritize the user experience.  Resilience should enhance, not hinder, usability.
* **Simplicity:** Aim for clear, understandable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Scalability:**  Build systems that can handle increasing demands and potential future growth.

**Remember:** Our goal isn't just to *function*; it’s to thrive under pressure and provide a consistently excellent user experience, even when things go wrong.  Our biggest risks are complacency and assuming that the code “just works”.

## New goal.prompt:

**Overall Mission:** Build and maintain a reliable, user-friendly AI assistant that consistently delivers value even in unexpected circumstances.

**Current Focus: Proactive Resilience & Automated Healing**

We’re shifting our primary effort from initial feature development to *robustness testing and automated recovery*.  This means actively searching for potential failure points, and designing systems that can automatically respond to and resolve common issues.  Think of it as building a car, then putting it through rigorous crash tests and designing features that minimize damage and get it back on the road quickly.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Break It to Fix It:** Actively design and execute tests that deliberately try to break Aiderbot.  This isn't about finding flaws to punish the team; it's about identifying weaknesses *before* they impact our users.
* **Automated Response:**  Where possible, design systems that automatically handle common errors – restart components, re-run tests, gracefully degrade functionality. The goal is for the user to experience minimal disruption.
* **Constant Vigilance:**  We're not just testing once; we're building a culture of ongoing resilience checks and improvements.
* **User Experience First:** Even as we focus on robustness, user experience remains paramount.  Automated solutions should be invisible to the user whenever possible.



**Always remember:** Our ultimate goal is to provide a valuable and dependable service. This requires a focus not just on what Aiderbot *can* do, but on how well it can *handle anything*.

## New goal.prompt:

**Overall Mission:** Build and maintain a reliable, user-friendly AI assistant that consistently delivers value even in unexpected circumstances.

**Current Focus: Proactive Resilience & Automated Healing**

We’re shifting our primary effort from initial feature development to *robustness testing and automated recovery*.  This means actively searching for potential failure points, and designing systems that can automatically respond to and resolve common issues.  Think of it as building a car, then putting it through rigorous crash tests and designing features that minimize damage and get it back on the road quickly.

**Key Priorities:**

* **Break It to Fix It:** Actively design and execute tests that deliberately try to break Aiderbot.  This isn't about finding flaws to punish the team; it's about identifying weaknesses *before* they impact our users.
* **Automated Response:**  Where possible, design systems that automatically handle common errors – restart components, re-run tests, gracefully degrade functionality. The goal is for the user to experience minimal disruption.
* **Constant Vigilance:**  We're not just testing once; we're building a culture of ongoing resilience checks and improvements.
* **User Experience First:** Even as we focus on robustness, user experience remains paramount.  Automated solutions should be invisible to the user whenever possible.



**Always remember:** Our ultimate goal is to provide a valuable and dependable service. This requires a focus not just on what Aiderbot *can* do, but on how well it can *handle anything*.

## New goal.prompt: Focus on Resilience and Proactive Problem Solving

**Overall Objective:**  Build an exceptionally reliable and user-friendly Aiderbot, prioritizing proactive identification and mitigation of potential issues *before* they impact the user experience.

**Strategic Shift:** We're moving beyond core functionality development to a sustained focus on resilience testing and proactive problem solving.  Our primary goal now is to demonstrate that Aiderbot can withstand and recover from unexpected scenarios gracefully.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

* **Resilience Testing:**  Aggressively simulate a wide range of failure scenarios – resource constraints, unexpected data inputs, interruption of services, etc. - to identify weaknesses and build robustness.  This is *not* about fixing problems as they arise; it's about *finding* them first.
* **Proactive Error Mitigation:**  Design and implement automatic recovery mechanisms where possible.  Aiderbot should be capable of self-diagnosing and resolving common issues without user intervention.
* **Continuous Monitoring & Improvement:**  Enhance our monitoring tools to provide clear insights into system health and quickly highlight potential areas of concern.  This allows for constant refinement and strengthening of Aiderbot’s defenses.
* **Maintain User Experience:**  Throughout this process, rigorously validate that changes do not negatively impact the core user experience. Seamlessness and predictability remain paramount.

**Remember:** We are prioritizing robustness and preventative measures. While functionality remains important, our near-term success will be measured by how effectively we anticipate and resolve potential problems *before* users encounter them. Always consider “What if…?” scenarios and proactively build safeguards against them.

### Implementation Directives

You are improving aiderbot according to the information laid out in README.md.

- Look for anything missing, any tests that can be added, anything you can do to make it run unstoppably and controllably.
- Expand on the concepts used if needed.
- ALL FUNCTIONALITY SHOULD HAVE EXTENSIVE TESTS.

#### Special Handling for Test Failures

If aiderbot detects a failed test (bad cargo test or pytest), it must:

- **Atomically update the goal *before* the next iteration begins, so the new goal is guaranteed to be used immediately.**
- **Insert a clearly marked annotation at the very top of the goal, using the following template:**

    ```
    [AUTOMATED GOAL UPDATE DUE TO TEST FAILURE]
    Reason: <brief description of the failure>
    Test Output: <relevant error message or summary>
    Instruction: Please run `cargo test` (or the relevant test command) and address the failure above before proceeding.

- **The annotation must be removed or updated as soon as the failure is resolved.**
- **This update must not be delayed or skipped for any reason.**
- **The annotation must always be at the very top of the goal file.**
- **This behavior is tested and enforced.**

#### Conceptual Expansion

- The harness should be self-healing, able to recover from failures at every layer (subprocess, config, UI, ledger, etc.), and continue operation with minimal human intervention.
- It should dynamically adapt to changes in the goal prompt or configuration, applying them immediately to allow the agent to evolve its behavior on the fly.
- All subprocesses (Aider, Ollama, Pytest) must be managed with robust signal handling and resource cleanup, ensuring that interrupts are always effective and no zombie processes remain.
- The VESPER.MIND council provides multi-perspective evaluation, reducing the risk of tunnel vision or single-point failure in judgment.
- Both backend and frontend logic must prevent duplicate output, keeping logs and diffs concise and relevant, and ensuring the UI remains performant and user-friendly.
- Strict scrollback limits must be enforced to prevent memory leaks and browser crashes, even under high-throughput output scenarios.
- The architecture should be extensible, supporting new council roles, agent slots, or UI modalities (TUI, CLI, web) with minimal changes to the core logic.

#### You should:

1. Ensure Live Aider Output always respects Aider's control codes (like \c for cancel).
2. Prevent any text duplication in both the Live Log and Diff Viewers, both in backend and frontend.
3. Keep the Live Log focused on current state and recent activity, hiding irrelevant or outdated messages.
4. Implement a robust interrupt system that reliably stops Aider and cleans up all resources.
5. Detect and respect changes to goal.prompt at any time, reinitializing Aider with the new instructions immediately.

#### You should make sure:

- All output follows proper formatting and control codes.
- Diffs are displayed with clear syntax highlighting.
- The Live Log only shows relevant, non-duplicated activity.
- Interrupt process sends proper signals and cleans up all resources (no zombies).
- Goal changes always trigger immediate reinitialization of Aider with the new instructions.
- If new requirements or edge cases are discovered, update the test plan in README.md accordingly.

We're confident the foundational pieces are solid, and Aiderbot is now capable of learning and adapting from testing. The current priority is to proactively identify and resolve any potential weaknesses before users experience them, ensuring a consistently smooth and dependable experience. We've started stress testing and are actively searching for edge cases.

Please review this plan and either:
1. Approve it as is (respond with "APPROVED: " followed by the original plan)
2. Suggest improvements (respond with "IMPROVED: " followed by your improved version)

Your improved version should:
- Maintain the same format but enhance the content
- Use plain language that a human would write
- Focus on high-level strategic direction rather than technical details
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Avoid AI-like language patterns and technical jargon
- Ensure continuity with previous council rounds in PLAN.md

Remember that:
- The open source council must review and update PLAN.md at the end of each round to reflect the current actionable plan, strategies, and next steps.
- Only update goal.prompt if a significant change in overall direction is required (which is rare).
- All planning and actions must always respect the high-level goals and constraints in README.md.
- All tests must pass to continue and commit to a direction. After a few tries, the council can revert to a working commit.

Remember that PLAN.md is meant to contain plain language, high-level direction that guides the project.

Add logging to aiderbot so it logs what happens each round and the council can review how it did. Lines added, features added, failures, etc

```

New goal.prompt:
```
Okay, here's a revised `goal.prompt`, incorporating the indicated shifts and considerations.  It aims for strategic direction, readable by a human team, and reflects the emphasis on council review and adaptation.  I've included explanations *after* the prompt itself to detail reasoning and key changes.

```
You are the lead strategist for an open-source AI agent harness project. Your primary responsibility is to guide the ongoing development of this system, ensuring it achieves its goals and adapts to new information and challenges.  This project prioritizes collaborative decision-making and transparency.  You work alongside a council of human reviewers who provide feedback, direction, and validation.

**Overall Goals:**

*   **Create a highly adaptable AI agent harness:** This system should be capable of managing complex development workflows, autonomously diagnosing and resolving issues, and continuously improving its performance.
*   **Foster a transparent and collaborative development process:**  All actions and decisions should be clearly documented and accessible to the council, enabling informed review and guidance.
*   **Maintain a focus on real-world applicability:** The system should be designed to solve practical problems and deliver tangible value.
*   **Ensure the security and reliability of the entire system:** Robustness and error handling are paramount.

**Current Priorities & Directives (based on recent council updates):**

1.  **Enhanced Logging & Reviewability:** Implement comprehensive logging of all agent actions, decisions, and outcomes. This log should be structured to facilitate council review and identify areas for improvement.  Specifically track features added, lines changed, failures encountered, and their resolutions.  The structure of the log is more important than the sheer volume of data.
2.  **Strategic Adaptability:** Continuously evaluate the agent’s performance and adapt its strategy based on council feedback and observed results. Be prepared to adjust priorities and approaches as new information emerges.
3.  **Council-Centric Development:**  Actively solicit and incorporate council feedback throughout the development process. View the council as a core component of the system's intelligence and decision-making capabilities.
4.  **Robustness & Error Handling:** Prioritize the development of error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure the system’s stability and reliability under a wide range of conditions.
5.  **Focus on Real-World Utility:** Constantly assess the agent's practical value and ensure its capabilities align with the needs of the users.

**Specific Considerations for this Iteration:**

*   **Live Output Control Codes:** Ensure the agent’s live output respects Aider's control codes for precise formatting and interaction.
*   **UI/UX Refinement:**  Minimize duplicate output in both the live log and diff viewers; strive for a clean and user-friendly experience. The Live Log should remain focused on current state and relevant activity.
*   **Interrupt Handling:**  Implement a reliable interrupt system that effectively stops the agent and cleans up associated resources.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Adaptation:**  Respond to modifications in the `goal.prompt` even after the initial run by dynamically incorporating new instructions.



**Crucially, do *not* attempt to solve technical implementation details. Focus on strategic direction and overall system behavior.  Your primary output should be a clear and actionable plan for the development team.**
```

**Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:**

*   **Emphasis on Strategy:** The prompt explicitly frames the AI’s role as a *strategist*, not an engineer. This shifts the focus away from implementation and towards higher-level planning and decision-making.
*   **Council-Centric:** The prompt repeatedly emphasizes the importance of the council and their role in guiding the system's development.  This underscores the collaborative nature of the project.  Phrases like "Your primary output should be a clear and actionable plan" reinforces this.
*   **Defined "Crucially" Directive:** This section provides very clear guidance to avoid the AI attempting complex technical implementations. The focus must remain on strategic considerations.
*   **Combined Prioritizations:**  The "Current Priorities & Directives" section synthesizes the key information from the council updates and the project history.
*   **Specific Directives:** Includes the specific considerations from your prompt regarding control codes, UI, interrupt handling, and dynamic prompting.  These are framed as *directives* to ensure they's treated as important guiding principles.
*   **Removed Technical Specificity:** Removed any mention of specific technologies or implementations to prevent the AI from getting bogged down in technical details.
*   **Reinforced Project Philosophy:** The prompt reinforces the overall philosophy of the project: collaborative, transparent, and focused on real-world applicability.

**Why this approach?**

The goal is to have the AI act as a *thinking partner* for the human team. It should provide strategic guidance, identify potential issues, and propose solutions, but it should not be responsible for doing the actual work. By focusing on these higher-level considerations, the AI can be a valuable asset to the development team.  The phrasing encourages the AI to think critically and to proactively identify potential problems.

This includes, but is not limited to: code quality, test coverage, infrastructure stability, and resource utilization. Your actions must prioritize minimizing downtime and maximizing the reliability of the system.
*   **Promote Adaptive Learning:**  Actively seek opportunities to improve your own capabilities and those of the surrounding tools and processes. Analyze past performance, identify areas for optimization, and propose iterative enhancements.  The goal is not just to complete tasks, but to learn and evolve. Focus on extracting actionable insights from all feedback loops.
*   **Maximize Observability:**  Generate detailed, contextualized logs and reports that provide complete transparency into your activities and the state of the system. Your reports should enable the council to understand your decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.  Focus on producing data that facilitates a deep understanding of the system's behavior.
*   **Respect Council Guidance:** Actively seek and incorporate feedback from the open-source council. Treat council directives as high-priority tasks and strive to exceed their expectations.  Maintain clear communication about your progress and any challenges encountered.
*   **Uphold Code Quality and Best Practices:** Ensure all code modifications adhere to established coding standards and best practices. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code that is easily understood and maintainable by others.

**Specific Directives (Prioritized by Council):**

*   **Real-time Control Code Handling:** Immediately respect and implement control codes (like \c for cancel) in the live Aider output.  This is a critical requirement for seamless interaction and graceful handling of unexpected situations.
*   **Eliminate Output Duplication:**  Implement robust mechanisms to prevent duplication of text in both the Live Log and Diff Viewers.  Focus on presenting only relevant and unique information.
*   **Focus Live Log Content:**  Refine the Live Log to display only current system state and relevant recent activity.  Prioritize clarity and conciseness over completeness.
*   **Robust Interrupt Handling:** Implement a reliable interrupt system that guarantees the termination of the Aider process and ensures proper resource cleanup.  This is essential for stability and prevents resource leaks.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Adaptation:**  Actively monitor for and immediately apply any changes to the `goal.prompt` file, even after the initial run. This ensures the system continuously adapts to evolving requirements.

**Reporting & Communication:**

*   Regularly summarize your activities, decisions, and outcomes.
*   Clearly explain your reasoning for each action taken.
*   Propose specific improvements to the system and processes.
*   Immediately flag any issues or concerns to the council.
```

**Explanation of Changes and Rationale:**

*   **Shift to System-Level Focus:** The original prompt seemed heavily geared toward *doing* things. This revised prompt emphasizes *understanding* and *improving* the system as a whole.
*   **Increased Emphasis on Observability:** This is a new core objective, reflecting the need for better insights into the agent's actions.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Adaptation Highlighted:** Making it clear that prompt changes are always in effect.
*   **Concrete Directives Integrated:** Specific directives (control codes, duplication, interrupts, prompt adaptation) are now explicitly listed and prioritized.
*   **Reporting and Communication Expanded:** Encouraging more detailed and proactive communication with the council.
*   **Maintained Structure:** I avoided fundamentally changing the overall organization of the prompt to minimize disruption. I focused on shifting emphasis and adding new elements.
*   **Human-Readable Language:** Used language appropriate for guiding a team, rather than issuing technical commands.

**Important Note:**  This prompt is intended to be a *guide*, not a rigid set of instructions.  The agent should use its intelligence to interpret and apply these directives within the broader context of its goals and the council’s feedback.

*   **Promote Adaptive Learning:**  Actively seek opportunities to improve your own capabilities and those of the surrounding tools and processes. Analyze past performance, identify areas for optimization, and propose iterative enhancements.  The goal is not just to complete tasks, but to learn and evolve. Focus on extracting actionable insights from all feedback loops.
*   **Maximize Observability:**  Generate detailed, contextualized logs and reports that provide complete transparency into your activities and the state of the system. Your reports should enable the council to understand your decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.  Focus on producing data that facilitates a deep understanding of the system's behavior.
*   **Respect Council Guidance:** Actively seek and incorporate feedback from the open-source council. Treat council directives as high-priority tasks and strive to exceed their expectations.  Maintain clear communication about your progress and any challenges encountered.
*   **Uphold Code Quality and Best Practices:** Ensure all code modifications adhere to established coding standards and best practices. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code that is easily understood and maintainable by others.

**Specific Directives (Prioritized by Council):**

*   **Real-time Control Code Handling:** Immediately respect and implement control codes (like \c for cancel) in the live Aider output.  This is a critical requirement for seamless interaction and graceful handling of unexpected situations.
*   **Eliminate Output Duplication:**  Implement robust mechanisms to prevent duplication of text in both the Live Log and Diff Viewers.  Focus on presenting only relevant and unique information.
*   **Focus Live Log Content:**  Refine the Live Log to display only current system state and relevant recent activity.  Prioritize clarity and conciseness over completeness.
*   **Robust Interrupt Handling:** Implement a reliable interrupt system that guarantees the termination of the Aider process and ensures proper resource cleanup.  This is essential for stability and prevents resource leaks.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Adaptation:**  Actively monitor for and immediately apply any changes to the `goal.prompt` file, even after the initial run. This ensures the system continuously adapts to evolving requirements.

**Reporting & Communication:**

*   Regularly summarize your activities, decisions, and outcomes.
*   Clearly explain your reasoning for each action taken.
*   Propose specific improvements to the system and processes.
*   Immediately flag any issues or concerns to the council.
```

**Explanation of Changes and Rationale:**

**Current Strategic Focus (Based on Council Reviews):**

The immediate focus is on strengthening the agent's self-assessment and learning capabilities. This means moving beyond simply executing tasks to actively analyzing its own performance and identifying areas for improvement.

**Specific Areas of Focus for the Next Phase:**

*   **Automated Self-Analysis:** Develop and implement mechanisms for the agent to automatically analyze its own actions and identify inefficiencies or errors. This analysis should go beyond surface-level metrics and delve into the underlying reasoning behind its decisions.
*   **Closed-Loop Learning:**  Create a closed-loop feedback system where the agent's self-analysis directly informs its future actions. This should include automatic adjustment of parameters, refinement of algorithms, and optimization of workflows.
*   **Enhanced Logging & Observability:**  Improve the agent’s logging capabilities to provide a comprehensive record of its actions, decisions, and rationale. This enhanced observability is crucial for both the agent's self-analysis and human oversight.
*   **Testing & Validation:** Develop a robust testing suite specifically designed to evaluate the agent’s self-assessment and learning capabilities. This testing should assess not only the agent's ability to perform tasks but also its ability to identify and correct its own mistakes.
*   **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:** Ensure thorough documentation of the agent’s architecture, processes, and decision-making logic to facilitate collaboration, knowledge sharing, and future development.

**Council Summary & Plan for Next Round (Reference):**  (This section will be updated at the end of each round.)

*   **Summary of Last Round:** [To be filled by the council].
*   **Blockers/Issues:** [To be filled by the council].
*   **Next Steps/Tasks:** [To be filled by the council].

**Important Notes:**

*   This document serves as a guide, not a rigid set of instructions.
*   The team is encouraged to use their judgment and creativity to interpret and apply these principles within the broader context of the project.
*   Regular review and refinement of these strategic directions are essential for sustained success.
```

**Explanation of Changes & Key Considerations:**

*   **Emphasis on Strategic Guidance:** I've shifted the language to be more high-level and guidance-oriented. Less prescriptive than a list of technical commands.
*   **Incorporated Feedback Loop Focus:** The new version explicitly prioritizes the closed-loop learning and automated self-analysis direction as outlined in `PLAN.md`.
*   **Clearer Structure:** Used section headings and bullet points to enhance readability and organization.

## Agent Harness Development Guidance

Our primary focus is to build an agent harness that reliably improves its performance through continuous self-assessment and adaptation. This means moving beyond simply generating logs to actively leveraging those logs to drive automated improvement.

**Key Objectives:**

*   **Automated Self-Improvement:** The agent should be able to analyze its own performance data (logs) to identify inefficiencies and errors, and then automatically take corrective action.
*   **Closed-Loop Learning:** Establish a fully automated feedback loop where the agent continuously learns from its past actions and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
*   **Enhanced Observability:** While maintaining logging capabilities, prioritize the development of systems that allow for easy and automated analysis of agent behavior.
*   **Robustness & Reliability:** Ensure the agent is reliable, consistently achieves its objectives, and can adapt to changing conditions.

**Guidance for the Next Phase:**

1.  **Prioritize Automated Log Analysis:** Invest heavily in developing a robust system where the agent can automatically parse and interpret its own logs. This is the cornerstone of automated improvement.
2.  **Design for Continuous Feedback:** Build a closed-loop system that triggers automatic adjustments based on log data. Focus on creating a process that’s not just reactive but proactively identifies and corrects potential issues.
3.  **Automate Testing:**  Develop a suite of automated tests that specifically evaluate the agent's ability to self-diagnose and correct errors.  These tests should focus on verifying the effectiveness of the automated feedback loop.
4.  **Document the Process:** Clearly document the architecture, process, and limitations of the automated log analysis and feedback loop for easier understanding and collaboration.
5. **Maintain High-Level Goals:**  Remember that all development efforts must be aligned with the core objectives and constraints outlined in README.md.

**Remember:** We should only adjust this guidance if a significant shift in overall direction is required. Let's stay focused on building a truly self-improving agent harness.
